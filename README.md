# Unity Game (Flappy Bird)

My first unity game learning experience on Unity 6. 

Sounds downloaded from [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/).

Project is for learning purposes only. Not for distribution.

You can play the game by downloading the latest release. Windows Threat & Protected Real Time may need to be disabled for the download to come through.
